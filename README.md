# Analyzing International Debt Statistics
This project aims to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The objective is to answer questions such as the total amount of debt owed by countries, which country owns the maximum amount of debt, and what is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators.

## Sections
The project consists of seven sections:

The World Bank's international debt data
Finding the number of distinct countries
Finding out the distinct debt indicators
Totaling the amount of debt owed by the countries
Country with the highest debt
Average amount of debt across indicators
The highest amount of principal repayments

## Tools Used
The project was developed using Jupyter notebooks. PyCharm Community Edition can be used to open and view the notebooks in read-only mode. PyCharm Professional can be downloaded for full support for local notebooks. Alternatively, DataSpell can be used as a dedicated IDE for data science with full support for local and remote notebooks. Datalore is available as an online environment for Jupyter notebooks in the browser.

## Running the Project

To run the project, PostgreSQL and the necessary libraries should be installed. The project uses SQL to query the database, and the SQL magic function %%sql is used to execute the SQL queries within the Jupyter notebook.
