# Analyze International Debt Statistics

This project analyzes international debt data collected by The World Bank, with the objective of answering questions such as the total amount of debt owed by countries, which country owns the maximum amount of debt, and what is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators.

This project was developed using Jupyter notebooks, which can be used with PyCharm Community Edition in read-only mode. For full support for local notebooks, PyCharm Professional can be downloaded and tried. Alternatively, for a dedicated IDE for data science with full support for local and remote notebooks, DataSpell can be tried. For an online environment for Jupyter notebooks in the browser, Datalore is available.

The project consists of seven sections:

The World Bank's international debt data
Finding the number of distinct countries
Finding out the distinct debt indicators
Totaling the amount of debt owed by the countries
Country with the highest debt
Average amount of debt across indicators
The highest amount of principal repayments
To run the project, PostgreSQL and the necessary libraries should be installed. The project uses SQL to query the database, and the SQL magic function %%sql is used to execute the SQL queries within the Jupyter notebook.
